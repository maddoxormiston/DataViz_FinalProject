## Project

maternity map with points, change year and variable
maternity var vs var, can change vars and year

line plot: select a county, select a hospital?, select a category, select a measure? would need a wait and submit button so not too overwhelming

scatterplot: options: compare one variable over different years, compare multiple variables:
- first option: choose variable, choose year for x- and y-axis
- second option: choose year, choose variable for x- and y-axis
add an option to aggregate over all years?
