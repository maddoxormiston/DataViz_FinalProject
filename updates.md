Looked at available data sets for public health data. Looked at preexisting shiny apps on rstudio to get ideas.

## March 23 Beginning of Class

Decided on project idea. Pulled data and previous wrangling code.

## March 23 End of Class

imported data set with longitude and latitude data for all hospitals, filled in missing or incorrect values and tidied data a bit. created leaflet map that displays where hospitals are and creates popup for hospital name, troubleshot a problem where markers weren't appearing. wrote down ideas that came out of classmate conversation for shiny tabs

## March 28 Beginning of Class

Worked on creating a leaflet visualization that changes based on which variable is selected that will be used in the shiny app. Created static scatterplots that change based on variable/years selected to later be used in shiny app. Started building ui for shiny and got stuck trying to figure out how to have the sidebar change for different tabs on app.
